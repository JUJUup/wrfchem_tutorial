     The file mozcart.inp is a template setup to map emissions from the 
     Community Earth System Model (CESM) dataset to the matching WRF-Chem species 
     assuming the MOZCART chemistry option (chem_opt = 112). 

     The template is provided as an example to help the users set up their own
     namelist to prepare anthropogenic emission data sets for their WRF-Chem simulations.

     Please note :

     (a) the anthro_dir variable must be set to the directory containing
         the input anthropogenic emission datasets

     (b) the input anthropogenic emission datasets all have a file name of
         the form, in this example :

         IPCC_emissions_<species>_surface_1850-2000_1.9x2.5.nc

         where <species> is one of the names in the src_names variable such
         as NO

     (c) since there is no molecular weight information in the CESM emission
         datasets all the species specified in the spc_nam variable have
         a molecular weight suffix

     (d) only the variable "anthro" is read from each CESM dataset

     (e) anthro_emis will output a series of wrfchemi_d01_<date> files

         starting at <date> = 2010-05-01_00:00:00 
         ending   at <date> = 2010-10-31_00:00:00
         
         each output file is for a single time, <date>, with a one day
         interval between files.

         thus the files form the following sequence :

         {wrfchemi_d01_2010-05-01_00:00:00, wrfchemi_d01_2010-05-02_00:00:00, 
                                          .
                                          .
          wrfchemi_d01_2010-10-30_00:00:00, wrfchemi_d01_2010-10-31_00:00:00} 

     (f) anthro_emis expects all output dates to be bracketed by the times spanning
         the IPCC emissions files

     Refer to the documentation in the file README.anthro_emis if you have any
     questions about the settings in the mozcart.inp file.
